### Steps : 
**1- Filled Map** for the number of shows by country: I started by visualizing the global distribution of TV shows and movies available on Amazon Prime Video using a map. This provides an overview of how content is spread across different countries, helping to identify regions with the highest or lowest number of shows.

**2- Donut chart** for filtering the number of TV shows and movies: I used a donut chart to allow users to filter between TV shows and movies. This makes it easy to compare the relative amounts of each type of content and to analyze their proportions within the data.

**3- Area chart** to track the evolution of shows over the years: I included an area chart to display how the number of shows has evolved over time. This chart reveals trends in content production, showing increases or decreases in shows released each year.

**4- Stacked bar chart** for the number of shows by genre or category: To analyze the distribution of content by genre, I used a stacked bar chart. This visualization breaks down the number of shows in each genre, allowing users to see which categories dominate the platform.

**5- Stacked bar chart** for ratings: Another stacked bar chart was used to show the distribution of ratings for TV shows and movies. This allows users to see how content is rated by viewers and understand the overall reception of different shows.

**6- Cards** for totals of shows, actors, countries, genres, and directors: Finally, I used cards to display key statistics, including the total number of shows, actors, countries represented, genres, and directors. These summary metrics provide a quick overview of the dataset and offer important context.

### Conclusion : 
This Amazon Prime Video dashboard offers a detailed view of TV shows and movies with global distribution maps, donut charts for content filtering, area charts for historical trends, and stacked bar charts for genre and rating insights. The summary cards provide key statistics on shows, actors, countries, genres, and directors. Explore and gain valuable insights into the content landscape!
